Propositions, declaritive statements, possible utterances, all are presumed to have logical interpretations.

A truth functional interpretation of utterances commonly maps from a set of utterances into a set of truth values.

For example the statement "the dog has fleas" is generally considered to be the type of statement that can either be determined to be true or determined to be false.

However, the statement "the dog will have fleas next week" can not be determined until next week.
This criticism, traced to Aristotle, of classical truth functional semantics is based on the incompleteness of a two valued interpretation.

This is known historically as the problem of future contingents<a href="#[0]">[0]</a>.
While it is perfectly clear what the statement means, it cannot be determined to be true or determined to be false.

This leads to truth value gaps in the classical analysis.

Another sort of undecidable statement is the sort Godel produced.

That is, formally undecidable statements.
While future contingent statements and formally undecided statements are different sorts of statements, the end result is the same.

Namely, both leave the epistemic system in an undecided state.

The last type of statement or declarative utterance one might be confronted with is one where (i) either lack of appropriate vocabulary (ii) inability to grammatically piece together the utterance into a semantically meaningful statement or (iii) both grammaticallity and lexical information are sufficient, but incongruity of meanings prohibits understanding.
These types of statements are considered meaningless.
