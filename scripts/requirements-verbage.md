From reading on Requirements Notation and Conventions from NIST, the National Institute of Standards and Technology


We have a need to clearly define the modality represented by the following word pairs:

* “SHALL” and “SHALL NOT”
* “SHOULD” and “SHOULD NOT” 
* “MAY” and “NEED NOT” 
* “CAN” and “CANNOT” 


The terms “SHALL” and “SHALL NOT” indicate requirements to be followed strictly in order
to conform to the publication and from which no deviation is permitted.

The terms “SHOULD” and “SHOULD NOT” indicate that among several possibilities one is
recommended as particularly suitable, without mentioning or excluding others, or that a certain
course of action is preferred but not necessarily required, or that (in the negative form) a certain
possibility or course of action is discouraged but not prohibited.


The terms “MAY” and “NEED NOT” indicate a course of action permissible within the limits of
the publication.

The terms “CAN” and “CANNOT” indicate a possibility and capability, whether material,
physical or causal or, in the negative, the absence of that possibility or capability.
